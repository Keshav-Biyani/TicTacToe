# Tic Tac Toe - Wear OS

This is a simple two-player Tic Tac Toe game designed for Wear OS smartwatches. The game is built using **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose** with **Canvas** for drawing the game board, Circle (O), and Cross (X). It also includes animations for enhanced visual feedback.

## Features

- **Two-player mode**: Play with a friend directly on your smartwatch.
- **Canvas-based board**: Custom-drawn Tic Tac Toe grid using Jetpack Compose's `Canvas`.
- **Player moves**: Players alternate turns between Circle and Cross.
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and interactions for a better gaming experience.
- **Winning detection**: Displays an alert dialog when a player wins or the game ends in a draw.
- **Replay or exit**: After each game, players can either replay or close the app.
- **State management**: Managed using `ViewModel` for seamless game flow and state preservation.
